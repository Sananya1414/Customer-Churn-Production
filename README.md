# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction

Customer Churn Prediction is a project aimed at predicting whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a company's services) based on their historical data. This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform binary classification, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict customer churn based on a variety of features. The model uses a deep learning approach, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to learn patterns from the data and make predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Libraries used to build and train the ANN model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data splitting and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting the confusion matrix.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data**:
   The dataset is loaded using Pandas and the first few rows are inspected to understand its structure.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   The features (X) are separated from the target variable (y), which indicates whether a customer has churned or not.

3. **Data Encoding**:
   If the dataset contains categorical variables, they are encoded into numerical values. This can be done using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. **Data Splitting**:
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.

5. **Feature Scaling**:
   The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data, which helps in speeding up the convergence of the neural network.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: The input layer with 26 neurons corresponding to the 26 features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers with 26 and 15 neurons, respectively, using the ReLU activation function.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with the sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(26, input_shape=(26,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(15, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Training the Model

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. It is trained for 100 epochs, with accuracy as the evaluation metric.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using accuracy and a confusion matrix to understand the model's predictive power.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Loss: {loss}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Plotting the confusion matrix
y_pred_prob = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred = (y_pred_prob > 0.5).astype(int).flatten()
cm = tf.math.confusion_matrix(labels=y_test, predictions=y_pred)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
sn.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Truth')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to predict customer churn. By leveraging an Artificial Neural Network, we can capture complex patterns in the data, leading to accurate predictions. The project showcases the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
